# Python Practice Repository

This repository will follow my learning of Python 3, in an attempt to become a Data Scientist. I will try to solve exercises and challenges from different sources, and develop my own projects as I go on.

First, I will focus on Real Python's book _Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3_, and on _50 Days of Python: A challenge a day_ by Benjamin Bennett Alexander.
