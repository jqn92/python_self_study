# Python Practice Repository


This repository will follow my learning of Python 3, in an attempt to become a Data Scientist. I will try to solve exercises and challenges from different sources, and develop my own projects as I go on.

First, I will focus on Real Python's book Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3.
