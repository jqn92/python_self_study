# Python Practice Repository

This repository will follow my learning of Python 3, in an attempt to become a Data Scientist. I will try to solve exercises and challenges from different sources, and develop my own projects as I go on.

First, I will focus on Real Python's book _Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3_, and on _50 Days of Python: A challenge a day_ by Benjamin Bennett Alexander.

February 11th, 2025 update - After a couple of weeks studying the basics, I found myself struggling a little bit with some challenges. By looking at the solutions, I realized that, while I can understand most of the code, I lack the imagination and/or the ability to produce said code to solve problems. I am not "thinking like a programmer" yet. In that sense, I believe I could benefit from complementing my practice (better sooner than later) with the projects in Al Sweigart's _The Big Book of Small Python Projects_ and _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners_. I will be covering those books' projects in this repository as well.
